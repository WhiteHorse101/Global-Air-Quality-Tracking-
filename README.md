<h1>Global Air Tracking with Azure Maps</h1>

Hey hi there folks ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I made made this small project with the help of Microsoft Learn. In this project I have made use of Azure Maps for plotting the AQI [Air Quality Index] on the map. 
This project was build using Python, Flask and an API called "World Air Quality Index" WAQI. 

You can find more about this project <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/azure-maps-track-air-pollution/7-visualize-pollution-data">here</a>

<h2> How to use this application </h2>

You will have to fork this repo for using it. Once forked clone it and run the home.html file contained in templates folder. 
Once you run the file the webpage will ask persmission to access your location if you give the application permission to access you location then your current location will be picked and the data of AQI will be shown. If your not willing to give your location then the default location of Microsoft's headquater in Redmond, Washington, United States will be used and the data will be shown. 

The data once plotted on the map may look like this.
